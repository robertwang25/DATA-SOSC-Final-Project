### Abstract:
China has experienced rapid urbanization and urban sprawl since the 1970s, while also placing significant emphasis on secondary school education. However, limited research exists on the city-specific impact of urban sprawl on access to secondary schools in China. This study aims to address this gap by employing regression models to examine how various factors of urban sprawl influence access to secondary education in Chinese cities using 2014 data. Additionally, a neural network model and time series regressions are utilized to predict cities that may face education access challenges due to urban sprawl. The findings reveal a negative relationship between urban sprawl and access to secondary schools, as indicated by the regression models, although the accuracy of the models is not perfect. Furthermore, a list of cities at risk of education access issues due to urban sprawl is generated using the neural network model, necessitating further investigation to validate the impact on secondary school access in these cities. This study sheds light on the implications of urban sprawl for secondary education and emphasizes the need for targeted interventions and policies to ensure equitable access amidst urbanization in China.
